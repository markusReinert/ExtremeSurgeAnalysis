# ExtremeSurgeAnalysis
Statistical extreme value analysis of storm surge levels with Python.

This repository contains the code belonging to an unpublished manuscript
by Markus Reinert *et al.* (2021).  Not all the code has been uploaded
so far, but will be before the manuscript is submitted.  The reference
to the paper will be added here as soon as it is published.

Example usage is shown in the file `Time-independent_GEV_fit.py`, which
produces the following result:
